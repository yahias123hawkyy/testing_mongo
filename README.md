in order to run it manually on your local machine you have to:


         1- install mongodb, run the server, create a new database called EVkaro then create a collection called "charger" .
         2- clone the code on your local machine.
         3- install the mongodb compass for a graphichal interface.
         4- run the function " insertImagetoDB " in order to put a document in your database.
         5- in the two other functions remove the id i put, and change it with the the one you inserted using the function " insertImagetoDB "
